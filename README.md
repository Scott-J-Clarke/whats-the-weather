# whats-the-weather

## Description

This is a weather application built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind, a utility-first CSS framework. It uses two separate API calls to OpenWeather, one for today's weather and the other for the 5-day forecast.

"What's the Weather?" has two basic features. The user can:

- type the name of a city into the search box and receive a general overview of the weather there
- click on a particular city from the search history and view its weather again

Through making "What's the Weather?" I:

- gained experience making API calls
- became more familiar with for loops
- worked with local storage a little more
